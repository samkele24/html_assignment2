        <p>Welcome to my personal page! Here, you will find different media elements that showcase who I am.</p>

        <h2>My Story: The Accidental Ctrl+Alt+Del of the Internet</h2>

        <p>Kelechi Oganeze was a <strong>talented developer</strong> with one unique skill—he could <em>break code that was already working.</em></p>

        <p>One fateful night, while debugging an app, Kelechi <strong>accidentally hit a mysterious key combination.</strong> The screen flickered, the lights dimmed, and suddenly... <strong>Google disappeared.</strong> 😱</p>

        <p>Yes. <em>The entire Google.</em></p>

        <p>Panic spread across the world. Developers screamed. Memes stopped loading. Stack Overflow? <strong>Gone.</strong></p>

        <p>Realizing his mistake, Kelechi did what any responsible programmer would do—<strong>he restarted his laptop.</strong> 💀💀💀</p>

        <p><strong>BOOM! 💥</strong> The internet <em>came back</em>, but now, every website displayed a warning:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"Warning: Kelechi has entered the chat."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p>To this day, no one knows what keys he pressed. But legend says, if you ever hear a developer mutter <em>"It works on my machine"</em>, Kelechi is probably nearby... <strong>watching, waiting, and accidentally breaking something.</strong> 😆🐞</p>
